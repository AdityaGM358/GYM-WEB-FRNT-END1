# GYM-WEB-FRNT-END1
Welcome to the GYM-WEB-FRNT-END1 repository! This repository contains a front-end design project for a gym subscription website. The website aims to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for users to explore and engage with various gym subscription options.

Description The Gym Subscription Website project focuses on creating an attractive and intuitive user interface for a gym membership platform. Although it is a front-end design project, it offers a solid foundation for building a fully functional website by integrating with a back-end and a database of your choice.

The website design is centered around promoting gym membership plans, highlighting their features, and encouraging users to sign up. The user interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

Key Components Landing Page: The landing page serves as the gateway to the website, providing an overview of the gym's offerings and enticing users to explore further.

Membership Plans: The website showcases various gym membership options, including different durations, pricing tiers, and benefits. Users can compare the plans and select the one that suits their needs.

Registration and Login: Users can create an account or log in to access their profile, manage their subscriptions, and enjoy personalized features.

Subscription Management: Once logged in, users can view their current subscription details, make changes to their membership (such as upgrading or downgrading), and cancel their subscription if necessary.

Payment Integration: The website seamlessly integrates with a payment gateway, allowing users to securely complete their membership purchases online.

User Dashboard: Each user has a dedicated dashboard where they can review their subscription history, update their profile information, and track their fitness progress.

Technologies Used The Gym Subscription Website project primarily focuses on front-end development and design. The key technologies and languages used in this project include:

HTML: Markup language for creating the website's structure and content.

CSS: Styling language for enhancing the website's appearance and layout.

JavaScript: Programming language for adding interactivity and dynamic functionality to the website. Please note that this project solely provides the front-end implementation and design. For a fully functional website, it needs to be integrated with a back-end framework and a database to handle user authentication, subscription management, and other dynamic features.

Feel free to explore and customize the Gym Subscription Website project to suit your specific requirements and design preferences.

GETTING STARTED: To run the program i have used visual studio code. It is necessary to download the live server extension. Very simple to run otherwise.
